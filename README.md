# secret-server-test

Test project for optimonk.
Fun fact: This was my first time ever working with Vue.

# How to run

1. Create `.env` file for docker-compose ( environment keys in `.env.example`. Same values can be used for fully functioning app )
2. Run `docker compose up`
3. Access the webapp in the browser at `http://localhost:8080`
